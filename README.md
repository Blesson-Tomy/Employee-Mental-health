# GTA Sandshores Hackathon: Employee-Mental-health

The Employee-Mental-Health project was initiated as a part of the GTA: Sandshores hackathon conducted by the Mulearn organisation in collaboration with Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM).

# PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Develop a web application that aims to work on increasing Women Empowerment: Unlocking Potential, Building Confidence, and Creating Opportunities for Women to Shape Their Futures.

# OUR SOLUTION:
We aimed to create a website where middle aged women can monetise their hobbies by selling on our platform. Afterwards, they can also hire other women who are interested to collab in creating a company or group hobby.
